This program emulates a classic DVD waiting screen, where the logo moves around
the screen, changing direction if it encounters a wall at the edge of the
screen. 

The logo 'logo.bmp' in the 'images/' directory can be switched out with
anything that fits within the resolution that can be found and changed in the
settings.py class. 

You will need the pygame module to run this program.
